# Filtration with IIR for Equalization & Replacing

IIR (infinite impulse response) filters are usually used for applications where the linear process is not too large and memory is constrained. They have been widely deployed in audio equalization, sensor signal processing, IoT/IIoT smart sensors and high-speed telecommunication or RF applications and form a crucial building block in algorithmic design. This code shows how easy it is to replace a Butterworth design with either a Chebyshev or an elliptical filter of the same order and to obtain a steeper roll-off at the expense of some ripple in the passband and/or stopband of the filter. The minimum order designs are explored after this.
